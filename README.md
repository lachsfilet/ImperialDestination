# Imperial Destination
Imperial Destination is a turn-based hex field strategy game inspired by [Imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism_(video_game)), realized with Unity3D
and written in C#.

## Introduction

advancing the industrialization, investing into research, building up the required infrastructure, arming

compared with the original.
